Teenage pregnancy is pregnancy in human females under the age of 20. A girl can become pregnant from sexual intercourse after she has begun to ovulate which can be before her first menstrual period (menarche), but usually occurs after the onset of her periods. In well-nourished girls, menarche usually takes place around the age of 12 or 13.
